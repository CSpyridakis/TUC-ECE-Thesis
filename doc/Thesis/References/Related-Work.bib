	abstract = {A real-time 3-D relative position estimator is presented for fixed-wing UAV swarm system in formation flight, using measurements from IMU, compass, GPS, and a set of UWB ranging radios. Instead of using stationary UWB anchors to provide 3-D coordinate and fusing it with IMU, the estimator uses UWB measurements for the construction of a non-convex function, and calculates the global optimum of the non-convex function to get position estimation, while the GPS positions are used to provide bearing information. Actual flight experiments with seven fixed-wing UAVs are conducted outdoors, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves lower distance estimation error between neighbor UAVs compared to traditional GPS/IMU/UWB fusing algorithm using EKF.},

	Abstract = {Many tasks performed by swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles require localization. In many cases, the sensors that take part in the localization process suffer from inherent measurement errors. This problem is amplified when disruptions are added, either endogenously through Byzantine failures of agents within the swarm, or exogenously by some external source, such as a GNSS jammer. In this paper, we first introduce an improved localization method based on distance observation. Then, we devise schemes for detecting Byzantine agents, in scenarios of endogenous disruptions, and for detecting a disrupted area, in case the source of the problem is exogenous. Finally, we apply pool testing techniques to reduce the communication traffic and the computation time of our schemes. The optimal pool size should be chosen carefully, as very small or very large pools may impair the ability to identify the source/s of disruption. A set of simulated experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which enable reliable error estimation even amid disruptions. This work is the first, to the best of our knowledge, that embeds identification of endogenous and exogenous disruptions into the localization process.},
