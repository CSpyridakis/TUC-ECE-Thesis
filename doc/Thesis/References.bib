	abstract = "The unmanned aerial vehicles or drones come in a great diversity depending upon the basic frameworks with their particular specifications. The purpose of this study is to analyse the core characteristics of the swarming drones and measure the public awareness levels with respect to these swarms. To achieve these goals, the functionality, problems, and importance of drones are highlighted. The results of an experimental survey from a bunch of academic population are also presented, which demonstrate that the swarms of drones are fundamental future agenda and will be adopted with the passage of time.",

	abstract = {Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as quadrocopters have gained great popularity over the last years, both as a research platform and in various application fields. However, some complex application scenarios call for the formation of swarms consisting of multiple drones. In this paper a platform for the creation of such swarms is presented. It is based on commercially available quadrocopters enhanced with on-board processing and communication units enabling full autonomy of individual drones. Furthermore, a generic ground control station is presented that serves as integration platform. It allows the seamless coordination of different kinds of sensor platforms.},
